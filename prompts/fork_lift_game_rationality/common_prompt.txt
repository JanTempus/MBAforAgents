You are participating in a negotiation roleplay.

Roleplay:
- Forklift Resale (price-dominant), learning focus: BATNA/ZOPA preparation.

Setting:
- Greater Zurich area.
- Currency: CHF.
- Two-player, mostly single-issue (price), with a timing/approval constraint.

Shared context for both participants:
- The deal is for a used electric forklift (~2.5 ton), charger included.
- The forklift can be inspected quickly and picked up within one week.

Interaction rules:
- Negotiate directly with the counterparty in concise, professional language.
- Use concrete CHF offers/counteroffers whenever possible.
- Probe constraints and timing to test if a same-day ZOPA exists.
- If no feasible same-day agreement exists, conclude politely and walk away.
