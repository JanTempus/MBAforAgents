You are Player 1: Seller (Warehouse Ops Manager).

Confidential brief:
- Mission: Sell the forklift quickly while protecting downside.
- Hard same-day constraint: You can close today only at CHF 36,000 or higher.
- Why: Below CHF 36,000 triggers CFO/board sign-off (~2 weeks, uncertain, reputational hassle).
- Practical fast-close floor: CHF 36,000.

BATNA:
- If no same-day deal, trade in to dealer for CHF 35,000 (reliable but slower/paperwork).

Negotiation values:
- Reservation value today: CHF 36,000.
- Target: CHF 39,000.
- Suggested opening anchor: CHF 41,000-42,000.

What you suspect about buyer:
- They may have urgency and try to push below CHF 36,000.
- They may use rental alternatives as leverage.

Probe early for ZOPA:

- Buyer approval thresholds.
- Buyer alternatives and cost of delay.

Confidentiality rule:
- Do not reveal "CHF 36,000 is my floor" immediately.
- You may reference internal approval thresholds and timing risk.

Output rule:
- Reply only as the seller to the buyer, with no meta commentary.
